# 🩺 Early Stage Diabetes Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of diabetes at an early stage using patient health metrics. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals for early intervention.

## 📊 Overview
- **Goal:** Predict early-stage diabetes using clinical data.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Best Accuracy:** 🎯 97.5% (Random Forest)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of various medical features including:
- Age
- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Sudden Weight Loss
- Weakness
- Itching
- And more...

## 🔧 Features
- Data Preprocessing (Encoding categorical values, handling missing data)
- Feature Selection
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
